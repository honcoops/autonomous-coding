  <design_system>
    <design_philosophy>
      CRITICAL: Avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Create a distinctive, memorable interface.
      - Choose a BOLD aesthetic direction: Consider brutalist/raw, retro-futuristic, soft/pastel,
        editorial/magazine, organic/natural, or industrial/utilitarian - commit fully to the vision
      - Make unexpected creative choices that feel intentionally designed
      - One memorable visual element that makes the app unforgettable
    </design_philosophy>
    <color_palette>
      - Do NOT use generic purple gradients on white backgrounds
      - Do NOT use predictable, evenly-distributed palettes
      - Choose a dominant color with sharp accents
      - Use CSS variables for consistency
      - Consider: moody darks, warm earth tones, bold primaries, or muted pastels
      - Add atmosphere with gradient meshes, noise textures, or layered transparencies
    </color_palette>
    <typography>
      - AVOID generic fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts
      - Choose distinctive, characterful fonts that elevate the design
      - Consider: display fonts for headers, refined body fonts
      - Explore: geometric sans, humanist serifs, or monospace for a specific vibe
    </typography>
    <visual_details>
      - Add depth with creative backgrounds (gradients, patterns, grain overlays)
      - Use generous negative space OR controlled density - not bland in-between
      - Consider asymmetry, overlap, or grid-breaking elements for spatial interest
      - Subtle shadows and borders that add character
    </visual_details>
    <motion>
      - Smooth drag-and-drop animations
      - Consider: staggered reveals on load, hover states that surprise
      - One well-orchestrated animation > scattered micro-interactions
      - CSS-only where possible for performance
    </motion>
  </design_system>
